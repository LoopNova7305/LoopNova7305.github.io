	<h1> Cicada 3301 </h1>
									  <h2> Summary/Brief History </h2>
<p> Cicada 3301 is a name given to an organization or person that on six occasions has posted a set of puzzles and alternate reality games to possibly recruit codebreakers/linguists from the public. The first internet puzzle started on January 4, 2012, and ran for approximately one month. A second round began one year later on January 4, 2013, and a third round following the confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 4, 2014. The stated intent was to recruit "intelligent individuals" by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved. No new puzzles were published on January 4, 2015. However, on January 5th, 2016, a new clue was posted.  In April 2017 another PGP signed message was found: Beware false paths. Always verify PGP signature from 7A35090F. That message explicitly denies the validity of any unsigned puzzle, as recently as April 2017.
The puzzles focused a lot on data security, steganography, cyrptography.  It has been called "the most elaborate and mysterious puzzle of the internet age"[11] and is listed as one of the "top 5 eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the internet" by The Washington Post and other newspapers, and much speculation exists as to its function. Many have speculated that the puzzles are a recruitment tool for the NSA, CIA, MI6, a "Masonic conspiracy" or a cyber mercenary group. Others have claimed Cicada 3301 is an alternate reality game, but the fact that no company or individual has taken credit or tried to monetize it, combined with the fact that no known individuals that solved the puzzles have ever come forward, has led most to feel that it is not. </p>
<h1>  What happened in 2012: The Beginning. </h1>
<p> Users browsing 4chan's /x/ board were greeted with a mysterious image, unlike much else really seen on that board. It displayed the following message in simple, white-on-black font: </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Cicada_3301_logo.jpg/220px-Cicada_3301_logo.jpg">
													       <p> and </p>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/uncovering-cicada/images/8/81/3301orig2012cesarincluded.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/461?cb=20140110060301">
<p> There was almost nobody browsing /x/ at that time who did not notice it. Many initially thought it was another ARG, some thought it was an NSA recruitment program, and to this day few know where the rabbit hole leads to, and those that do have disappeared from the internet and have not told anybody else any more than they fear to let on.
If it sounds like a scary story, that's because it is, yet its intrigue and mystery have captivated the minds of many.  This is the mystery, and world, of Cicada 3301. </p>
<p>  Because the message mentioned that he had a message inside, solvers were quick to try different methods to find it. The most common use was to initially open the image file into a text editing application, which allows users to read a dump of the bytes in the image. This produced the following text at the end of VS CLAVDIVS CAESAR says "lxxt> 33m2mqkyv2gsq3q = w] O2ntk"
This was quickly found to be a Caesar cipher (is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure) , hence the reference, and the deciphered text was obviously a URL, judging by the first 5 symbols is clearly a single letter followed letter, another single letter and a piece of punctuation. Decrypting this cipher led to the discovery of the following image: </p>

<p> This image file was a difficult clue to follow, but solvers soon realised that it meant that the program OutGuess had to be used (hence the words guess and out).
In its simplest form, OutGuess is a steganography program designed to hide messages within images. Opening the image in OutGuess led to the following message:
