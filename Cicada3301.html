	<h1> Cicada 3301 </h1>
									  <h2> Summary/Brief History </h2>
<p> Cicada 3301 is a name given to an organization or person that on six occasions has posted a set of puzzles and alternate reality games to possibly recruit codebreakers/linguists from the public. The first internet puzzle started on January 4, 2012, and ran for approximately one month. A second round began one year later on January 4, 2013, and a third round following the confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 4, 2014. The stated intent was to recruit "intelligent individuals" by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved. No new puzzles were published on January 4, 2015. However, on January 5th, 2016, a new clue was posted.  In April 2017 another PGP signed message was found: Beware false paths. Always verify PGP signature from 7A35090F. That message explicitly denies the validity of any unsigned puzzle, as recently as April 2017.
The puzzles focused a lot on data security, steganography, cyrptography.  It has been called "the most elaborate and mysterious puzzle of the internet age"[11] and is listed as one of the "top 5 eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the internet" by The Washington Post and other newspapers, and much speculation exists as to its function. Many have speculated that the puzzles are a recruitment tool for the NSA, CIA, MI6, a "Masonic conspiracy" or a cyber mercenary group. Others have claimed Cicada 3301 is an alternate reality game, but the fact that no company or individual has taken credit or tried to monetize it, combined with the fact that no known individuals that solved the puzzles have ever come forward, has led most to feel that it is not. </p>
<h1>  What happened in 2012: The Beginning. </h1>
<p> Users browsing 4chan's /x/ board were greeted with a mysterious image, unlike much else really seen on that board. It displayed the following message in simple, white-on-black font: </p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Cicada_3301_logo.jpg/220px-Cicada_3301_logo.jpg">
													       <p> and </p>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/uncovering-cicada/images/8/81/3301orig2012cesarincluded.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/461?cb=20140110060301">
<p> There was almost nobody browsing /x/ at that time who did not notice it. Many initially thought it was another ARG, some thought it was an NSA recruitment program, and to this day few know where the rabbit hole leads to, and those that do have disappeared from the internet and have not told anybody else any more than they fear to let on.
If it sounds like a scary story, that's because it is, yet its intrigue and mystery have captivated the minds of many.  This is the mystery, and world, of Cicada 3301. </p>
<p>  Because the message mentioned that he had a message inside, solvers were quick to try different methods to find it. The most common use was to initially open the image file into a text editing application, which allows users to read a dump of the bytes in the image. This produced the following text at the end of VS CLAVDIVS CAESAR says "lxxt> 33m2mqkyv2gsq3q = w] O2ntk"
This was quickly found to be a Caesar cipher (is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure) , hence the reference, and the deciphered text was obviously a URL, judging by the first 5 symbols is clearly a single letter followed letter, another single letter and a piece of punctuation. Decrypting this cipher, the cipher code used by Emperor Tiberius Caesar himself, led to the discovery of the following image: </p>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/uncovering-cicada/images/2/2b/Decoy.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20130801071409" alt="DuckMessagelol">
<p> This image file was a difficult clue to follow, but solvers soon realised that it meant that the program OutGuess had to be used (hence the words guess and out).
In its simplest form, OutGuess is a steganography program designed to hide messages within images. Opening the image in OutGuess led to the following message:
Here is a book code. To find the book, and more information, go to http://www.reddit.com/r/a2e7j6ic78h0j/. 1:20 2:3 3:5 4:20 5:5 6:53 7:1 8:8 9:2 10:4 11:8 12:4 13:13 14:4 15:8 16:4 17:5 18:14 19:7 20:31 21:12 22:36 23:2 24:3 25:5 26:65 27:5 28:1 29:2 30:18 31:32 32:10 33:3 34:25 35:10 36:7 37:20 38:10 39:32 40:4 41:40 42:11 43:9 44:13 45:6 46:3 47:5 48:43 49:17 50:13 51:4 52:2 53:18 54:4 55:6 56:4 57:24 58:64 59:5 60:37 61:60 62:12 63:6 64:8 65:5 66:18 67:45 68:10 69:2 70:17 71:9 72:20 73:2 74:34 75:13 76:21 Good luck. 3301 </p>

	  <p> Going to this website led to an image of a cicada and a countdown. Using OutGuess on the image produced the following message: </p>
<p>		  Both of them were signed with PGP signatures. PGPs are basically a completely secure method of ensuring that the message has come from the confirmed sender.
	More on PGP can be found below.</p>
	  <ul>

	  </ul>
	  <p> In the header of the subreddit, there was the following string given:
(The number sequence that is written using mayan numbers is as follows: 10 2 14 7 19 6 18 12 7 8 17 0 19
Comparing this with the a2e7j6ic78h0j7eiejd0120 in the title, we can see that numbers below 10 in the sequence above is also found in this string, at the same positions. Also note that instead of 10 we have “a”, instead of 14 we have “e”, and so on up to “j” being 19. Since the title of the page contains 23 characters and there were only 13 mayan numbers is is quite likely that we are supposed to continue converting characters from the title to numbers.) </p>
<p> Later was found that key was derived from King Arthur text. Translate each digit to a letter (from alphabet starting with A = 0) and you get kcohtgsmhirathosotnabca. Each letter is first letter in lines of decrypted text.
This was the 'key' that Problems mentioned, being the code to the shift cipher to be applied to the lines of text in the subreddit. If this is confusing, it basically means that each letter in each string was meant to be shifted by the number corresponding to it's location in the text. This produced the following story (not complete). </p>	  
	  <p> The code in the original message, as mentioned to be a book code, was applied here. If you're not familiar with book codes, the first number is the line, and the second number is the character in that line. Applying the book code to the text with the full stops removed gave the following string of text:
		  Call us at us tele phone number two one four three nine oh nine six oh eight, or 21433909608. </p>
	 <p> After calling this number this is what you would have heard (the number has since been deactivated): Very good. You have done well. There are three prime numbers associated with the original final.jpg image. 3301 is one of them. You will have to find the other two. Multiply all three of these numbers together and add a .com to find the next step. Good luck. Goodbye.  </p>
	  <p> Here is a simulated recording of it. </p>

	  </figure>
	  <p> The original image had the dimensions of 509 and 503, both of which are prime numbers. These were multiplied with 3301 to equal 845145127, which gave us http://845145127.com . Note that 845145127 is also in brackets in the GPG key's name. </p>

	  <p>  And so the solvers waited.  After a while, the site changed. </p>

	  <p> This led to locations around the globe, which meant for most solvers unless you had access you all these places, you had to work together.  Images of cicada were stuck to a telegraph pole, with a barcode that you could scan. </p>
	  <p> These locations were in Japan, France, Spain, Russia, Poland, South Korea, Australia, and many U.S states. This changed the game for everyone.  Until now, the possibility of this being an extremely clever prank was not outruled.  But now, the
mastermind behind this puzzle definetely had a GLOBAL reach.  Scanning the QR code led to two different images, both which being scanned using Outguess revealed two poems. Some of the telephone pole pictures are below. </p>
