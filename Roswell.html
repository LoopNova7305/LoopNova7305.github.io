          <h1> The Roswell Incident </h1>
          <h2> The events </h2>
          <p> The Roswell incident is one of the most famous alien coverups/incidents ever recorded.  In 1947, a msyterious object crashed
          near Roswell, New Mexico.  A rancher by the named of Mac Brazel found on his branch what looked like metallic sticks, glossy, metallic like
          paper, and weird plastics.  Upon calling the sheriffs, soldiers from the nearby Air Force Base came with armored trucks and 
          military vehicles to pick up all the materials.  New reports later came out saying the government had captured a flying saucer with
          alien bodies.  This quickly gained traction and may have started the ufology field. </p>  
          
          <p>Due to growing interest over the next few decades, as well as many UFO sightings, millions of people became interested in the Roswell 
          incident.  Many people came out and claimed to have worked for the government, and claimed the government was hiding alien technology
          specimens, and more.</p>        
                                                                           
         <h2> The Witnesses </h2>
         <p> Upon the initial incident,  the Mac Brazel himself came out and said there were alien bodies at the crash site, along with alien metal.
         Though the alien bodies' existence has yet to be proven, it is true that the metals found at the crash site were strange in origin.  They 
         would not bend even after being hit with a sledgehammer. A ufologist by the name of Glenn Dennis later stated that alien autopsies were carried
         out at Area 51.  More recently, in 2008, a flight engineer by the name of William Ennis, who was stationed at Area 51, stated that 
         there was in fact, an alien spacecraft that flew without engines, and that before he died, he would like to find out the whole truth.
         Though none of these statements truly hold much value, there is more evidence that inevitably points to the truth. </p>
         <h2> The Compelling Evidence. </h2>
         <p> There is much evidence that the Roswell incident was nothing more than a weather balloon crash or a balloon crash from
         Project Mogul, a top-secret U.S experiment to detect sound waves from Soviet nuke tests.  However, some evidence suggests otherwise. </p>
         <h3><Destruction of Files></h3>
         <p> A few decades after the Roswell incident, the government released to the public much of the details surrounding Project Mogul, thus
         proving to many the Roswell incident was nothing more than a hoax.  However, when requesting for files about the Roswell incident, it
         revealed the fact all the files from January 1947 to October 1947 at Roswell had either been destroyed or the government was hiding those files.
         Many conspiracy theorists have speculated that the government released the Project Mogul files in order to 1) lessen interest in the Roswell incident
         2) make the majority of people believe the Roswell incident was nothing, 3) simply because the files were now of no use them. </p> 
         <p>  Another compelling piece of evidence lies in that the metallic substances or metals were near invincible.  After being continously smashed with
         with a hammer and did even dent.  This would be normal for thicker metals, but this metal was extremely thin.  This would not be uncommon in today's world                                                                  
         as we have developed metamaterials much stronger than steel, but are extremely thin and light.  However, back in 1947, this would not have existed.
         This leads to two conclusions: either the government was far more advanced as we think, (many people believe the government to have technology 50 years of anything
         we have, regardless of alien interference or not) or the government had previously acquired alien technology. </p>
         <p>  Perhaps the most compelling evidene comes from a picture taken shortly after the incident.  A military officer (Mr. Ramey) was
         seen inspecting the material of the wreck, while holding a memo.  The memo is impossible to read by simply looking at the picture, but
         by using today's technology, we can decipher what it says.

          <h2> Other Conspiracy Theories Related to the Roswell Incident. </h2>
          Other theories include 1) Area 51 is used as a research facility to reverse engineer alien technology.  People suspect due to the highly secretive nature of Area 51.
          Area 51 is extremely well guarded and all lookout points near the area is closed.  Additionally, when doing a FOIA investagation, all Area 51 files are restricted.
          Also, people have reported UFO sightings near the area.  2) The government has alien beings/organisms in captive and are experimenting on them.
          There have been many photos 'leaked' with alleged alien organisms, but these are probably hoaxes.  However, the sheer amount of witnesses is odd.
          One may say by hoaxing and 'coming out' as a whistleblower, this would bring one fame and rewards, but when looking at it, what would a person gain by lying.  Badsically nothing.
          The number of witnesses coming definetely raises questions.
           <h2> Conclusion> </h2>
           Though we have compelling evidence from both skeptics and theorists, it is likely we will never find out the truth.  The best thing we can do is 
           continue the good fight for disclosure.  Only then will we be able to find out the truth behind everything.  For now, explore the rest of this website to find out more about the mysteries of the government, internet, and aliens.
